### 2. Backend API (Flask)

- Implements RESTful endpoints to serve frontend requests.
- Responsibilities:
  - Handling user authentication and session management.
  - Managing CRUD operations for user data, hazards, routines, and favorites.
  - Interfacing with Google Maps APIs for routing, geocoding, and traffic info.
  - Invoking ML models for congestion prediction and route optimization.
  - Returning JSON responses with data and status.

### 3. Database (SQLAlchemy ORM)

- Stores persistent data including:
  - User profiles and preferences.
  - Hazard reports and location data.
  - Daily routines and favorite places.
- Enables quick retrieval and update of records.
- Ensures data consistency and integrity.

### 4. External APIs

- **Google Maps API:**
  - Directions API for route calculations.
  - Geocoding API to convert addresses and coordinates.
  - Traffic API for real-time traffic data and incident reports.
- **Poway Open Data Portal:**
  - Local traffic datasets.
  - Road closures and hazard data.
  - Transit schedules.

### 5. Machine Learning Model

- Built using Python libraries (e.g., scikit-learn).
- Inputs:
  - Historical traffic data.
  - Real-time traffic and user route requests.
- Outputs:
  - Predicted congestion levels.
  - Suggested alternative routes for optimal travel times.
- Integrated with backend for dynamic decision making.

---

## Data Flow & Process

1. **User Interaction**
   - User opens frontend, inputs travel details, reports hazards, or manages routines.
   - Frontend sends REST API requests to backend.

2. **Backend Processing**
   - Validates and authenticates user requests.
   - Updates or queries the database accordingly.
   - Calls external APIs to fetch route and traffic data.
   - Invokes ML model to analyze congestion and optimize routes.
   - Aggregates data into a coherent JSON response.

3. **Response Delivery**
   - Backend sends processed data back to frontend.
   - Frontend updates map visuals and UI elements dynamically.

4. **Continuous Learning**
   - ML model retrains periodically with new traffic data.
   - System adapts to changing traffic patterns and improves recommendations.
