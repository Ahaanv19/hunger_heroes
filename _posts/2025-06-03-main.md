- Lottie Player – for embedding web animations.

- Jekyll Front Matter – used to integrate the page into a static site generator with settings like layout and navigation.

Geolocation Logic (JavaScript Summary)
- Waits for the page to load.

- Checks if the browser supports geolocation.

- Requests the user’s position with high accuracy.

- If access is granted:

     - Initializes a Leaflet map centered on the user.

     - Adds a tile layer from OpenStreetMap.

     - Places a marker on the user’s location.

- If access is denied or unavailable:

     - Alerts the user.

     - Optionally defaults to a preset location.

Intended User Experience
- The homepage is designed to be visually appealing, responsive, and intuitive. It should:

     - Immediately communicate the purpose and value of the platform.

     - Allow users to quickly access core routing features.

     - Provide a personalized map view based on their real-world location.

     - Offer fast and smooth navigation between sections.
